Don - The proof of concept for sorting a table using drag and drop is attached.  If you log in as "Admin" "Admin" in the login screen,
you will go to wSystemListPrimaryRegistrants.jsp.  You should be able to drag to sort the items in the list.  It wouldn't take much to
incorporate what is needed to implement the drag/sort mechanism. Let me know if you have any questions.
